1. Medium Level
Question:
Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again
Then, the output should be:
again and hello makes perfect practice world
Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
We use set container to remove duplicated data automatically and then use sorted() to sort the data.
Solution:
s = raw_input()
words = [word for word in s.split(" ")]
print " ".join(sorted(list(set(words))))
 2.Advance level
Question:
A website requires the users to input username and password to register. Write a program to check the validity of password input by users.
Following are the criteria for checking the password:
1. At least 1 letter between [a-z]
2. At least 1 number between [0-9]
1. At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
3. At least 1 character from [$#@]
4. Minimum length of transaction password: 6
5. Maximum length of transaction password: 12
Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma.
Example
If the following passwords are given as input to the program:
ABd1234@1,a F1#,2w3E*,2We3345
Then, the output of the program should be:
ABd1234@1

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
	Solutions:
	import re
	value = []
	items=[x for x in raw_input().split(',')]
	for p in items:
	if len(p)<6 or len(p)>12:
	continue
	else:
	pass
	if not re.search("[a-z]",p):
	continue
	elif not re.search("[0-9]",p):
	continue
	elif not re.search("[A-Z]",p):
	continue
	elif not re.search("[$#@]",p):
	continue
	elif re.search("\s",p):
	continue
	else:
	pass
	value.append(p)
	print ",".join(value)
